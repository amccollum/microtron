- tags are handled wrong. Need links, and need tidying (special URL trimming required)
- isodate.parse will parse "2010-101-25T11:44:00Z" without error
- maybe should do a regex check on datetimes before calling isodate.parse...
- should alter parser so calling code can just pass in a filename or url
  (caller shouldn't be exposed to lxml needlessly)

hNews-specific stuff:

- source-org: need to implement nearest-in-parent algorithm
- entry-content should be direct concatenation of elements - not just the stripped text (need to add a new type to uF descriptions?) applies to hatom too.
- hNews required hnews _and_ hentry to be present. Need a way to check.

fixed:
- added datetime type (eg hNews published/updated)
